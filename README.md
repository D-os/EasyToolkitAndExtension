The Easy Toolkit and Extension
=======================

A toolkit and extension on BeOS/Windows/POSIX, something likes BeOS API on other platforms more than BeOS. Now, it's mainly for C++ programing and just a few functions for C programing, maybe Obj-C in the future.
See README in "etkxx" folder for more info.
